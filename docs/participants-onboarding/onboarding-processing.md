# Onboarding Processing

The participants onboarding is the first step for the HCX switch to join and use the capabilites of the platform.

The onboarding should define a process to ensure authorized participants are entering into the system to use with the complete required details.&#x20;

The Swasth's Instance of the HCX switch has Staging and PoC environment to integrate and test the integration and different scenarios of claims. The onboarding process helps the participants to easily register and access the platform. Both the environments will have almost the same process to onboard.

## Scope:

The onboarding process is defined only for the **providers** and **payers** in this version. For all the other roles, the participants needs to send an email requesting to onboard and share the required credentials to access the platform.&#x20;

## Workflow of Participant Onboarding

The HCX gateway enabled the APIs to create, update and change the status to use the platform. But, it is important to define an onboarding process and allow only valid participants to the platform.

The HCX gateway from Swasth follows the below process to onboard the participant to the platform.

1. Initiate onboarding with basic information and communication details.
2. Verify the participant
   * Identity verification to ensure valid participant onboarding.
   * Communication details verification.
3. Updating the complete details to enable the participant.

Above are the **three high-level steps** to onboard any participant to the HCX gateway. It is essential to do the **identity verification** and **communication details verification** before enabling the participant to access the platform.
