# HCX Overview

Inspired by the recommendations of the Joint Working Group of NHA and IRDAI (2019), Health Claims Data Exchange (HCX) is an ambitious open-source project that aims to define interoperable protocol specifications to enable a multi-party exchange of health claims information.

The HCXs can be thought of as routing switches or email gateways that facilitate communication with the desired level of consistency, security, privacy, and durability. However, unlike the internet or email, this protocol is defined for a specialized use case of exchanging health claims-related information between relevant actors â€“ payers, providers, beneficiaries, regulators, observers, etc.
